# Searx Dark Theme

This is a dark theme for [searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/) the free internet metasearch engine. This theme can be applied to your browser with [stylish](https://userstyles.org) or [greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/).

It includes some minor improvements of the user interface. The categories are show all the time and don't have to be expanded with advanced settings. Setting time and language still work as with the oscar theme.

## Installation

The theme is availabe for stylish and greasemonkey (soon):

- Stylish: <br>
Install the theme from userstyles.org: [https://userstyles.org/styles/138093/searx-dark-theme-for-theme-oscar-logicodev](https://userstyles.org/styles/138093/searx-dark-theme-for-theme-oscar-logicodev). You can of course also copy and paste the text.

- Greasemonkey: <br>
not available yet. You can of course also copy and paste the text.

To make it work set the theme to «oscar» and the style to «Logicodev» in the preferences of your searx site. This setting is the default on most searx sites.
